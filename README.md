================

Screenbox is opensource system developed to support Digital Signage and digital advertising. Digital Signage System (DSS) consists of two applications: Screenbox Client and Screenbox Server ie. a controlling server and client "player". The server is used to create campaigns, edit media, convert to a format suitable for each client separately, and also to create playlists to target individual clients. Clients connected to the internet are automatically receiving/downloading server assigned playlists and related media at regular intervals.
